# Contrary to what the name might suggest, this file says nothing about who
# "owns" Contao. The software is based on contributions from various developers
# and and the intellectual property of each developer remains their own.

# We use this file so that GitHub automatically requests a review from someone
# when a pull request is added that modifies code that they "own". This can be
# code that they once contributed, but also code that they feel responsible for
# and want to stay informed about changes.
